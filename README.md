# Adventure
The classic Atari 2600 game!

# Description:
It's the legendary Atari 2600 game Adventure! Adventure was the very first in the action
adventure genre, inspiring games like The Legend of Zelda. Adventure was the very first game to
include an easter egg in the form of the creator's name on a secret screen. Adventure has now
been remade from the ground up for the TI-84 Plus CE calculator. The game has many improvements
but is still very much the complete and original game. Find the golden chalice and bring it back
to the yellow castle, but watch out! Dangerous dragons and treacherous bats stand in your way!

# Rules:
When starting the game, you will start on the title screen. Press any button to move on to the
difficulty selection screen. Pressing `X,T,θ,n` will toggle through the difficulty options.
Difficulty 1 has a smaller map, less mazes, no red dragon, and no bat. It is easier to escape
the dragons when they attempt to eat you. All items spawn in the same spots every playthrough.
Difficulty 2 has the full map, all three dragons, and the bat. All items spawn in the same spots
every playthrough. Difficulty 3 is the same as 2 except that the item positions are completely
randomized. There are measures in place to prevent a game that is impossible to finish, but in
a rare circumstance an impossible game may still happen. Press `mode` to start playing the game.
The goal of every game is to bring the golden chalice back inside the yellow castle.

# Controls:
Arrow Keys - As you might expect, the arrow keys move the player in the direction of the keys
             you are pressing.

`2nd` ------ Pressing `2nd` will make the player let go of the item they are holding.

`mode`----- Pressing `mode` will respawn the player back at the yellow castle. All dead dragons
             come to life, but items stay in their positions and the castle gates stay locked
             locked if they were locked, and unlocked if they were unlocked. Alternatively, if
             you are selecting a difficulty, pressing mode will start the game.

`X,T,θ,n` -- If you are in the middle of a game, pressing `X,T,θ,n` quits to the difficulty
             selection screen. If you are on the difficulty selection screen, pressing `X,T,θ,n`
             shifts throught the different difficulties.

`del` ------ Pressing `del` quits the game completely no matter when you press it.

# Items:
The Yellow Key ----- The yellow key locks or unlocks the gate at the yellow castle if you touch the
                     two together.

The Black Key ------ The black key locks or unlocks the gate at the black castle if you touch the
                     two together.

The White Key ------ The white key locks or unlocks the gate at the white castle if you touch the
                     two together.

The Sword ---------- The sword looks like a yellow arrow. It can be used to kill the dragons.

The Magic Bridge --- The magic bridge allows you to move up or down through it regardless of what is
                     the way - walls, dead dragon bodies, etc.

The Magnet --------- The magnet pulls one item that is in the same room towards itself. It is very
                     useful for  retrieving items that are inaccessible.

The Golden Chalice - The golden chalice needs to be taken inside the yellow castle in order to win
                     the game.

# Creatures:
Grindle, the Green Dragon - Grundle moves about 2/3 the speed of the player. If it sees the player,
                            Grundle will chase them down and attempt to eat them. If the player is
                            not around to be chased, then Grundle will wander until it finds the
                            black key, magic bridge, magnet, or golden chalice, which it will then
                            guard.

Yurgle, the Yellow Dragon - Yurgle moves about 2/3 the speed of the player. If it sees the player,
                            Yurgle will chase them down and attempt to eat them unless the yellow
                            key is present. Yurgle will run away from the yellow key. If the player
                            is not around to be chased, then Yurgle will wander until it finds the
                            golden chalice, which it will then guard.

Rhindle, the Red Dragon --- Rhindle moves at the same speed as the player. If it sees the player,
                            Rhindle will chase them down and attempt to eat them. If the player is
                            not around to be chased, then Rhindle will wander until it finds the
                            white key or the golden chalice, which it will then guard.

Knubberrub, the Bat ------- Knubberrub will take an item and run off with it. Eventually, it will
                            become hungry and try to take a new item, even if the player is
                            holding that item. Knubberrub can even pick up the dragons and move
                            them around! Unlike the dragons, Knubberrub can be picked up and moved
                            as if it was a regular item.
